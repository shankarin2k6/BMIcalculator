## 🌟 Overview

The **Advanced BMI Calculator** is a Flutter application developed to help users accurately calculate their **Body Mass Index (BMI)** using different units for height and weight.

Unlike basic BMI calculators that accept only standard units, this application supports **multiple unit selections** and automatically converts them into standard measurements. This ensures accurate BMI calculation along with a clear health classification.

The app also displays a **BMI reference table**, making it easier for users to understand their results.
